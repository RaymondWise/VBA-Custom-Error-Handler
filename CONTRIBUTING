##Contributing

1. Ensure you understand the License - https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT <See LICENSE file for specifics>
2. Create a Fork to make changes
3. If you want to merge those changes, create a pull request and describe the changes you made
4. If you don't want to merge with the main repo - you don't have to!
5. Submitting issues should be for issues or ideas, *not questions*
6. Use the contact information for questions

Please don't be shy, there's nobody that will judge you here.
